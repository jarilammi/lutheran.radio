/// - Article: Shared State Management for Widgets and Extensions
///
/// `SharedPlayerManager` is a **pure dispatcher** that enables safe state sharing
/// between the main app, widgets, and Live Activities via App Groups + `UserDefaults`.
///
/// **Division of responsibilities (Single Source of Truth)**:
/// - `DirectStreamingPlayer` owns actual playback state, stream selection, error state,
///   and all mutations to the AVPlayer.
/// - `SharedPlayerManager` owns the **visual/intent state** (`currentVisualState` of type
///   `PlayerVisualState`) and is the only place that should be consulted for "what should
///   the UI/widget/Live Activity show right now?".
///
/// Core responsibilities:
/// - **Visual State SSOT**: `PlayerVisualState` (`.prePlay`, `.playing`, `.userPaused`,
///   `.thermalPaused`, `.securityLocked`) with strict "sticky .userPaused" resurrection protection.
/// - **Widget / Intent actions**: Optimistic instant feedback via App Group + Darwin notifications;
///   the main app performs the real work and persists authoritative state.
/// - **State persistence**: `saveCurrentState()` + `saveVisualState()` for cross-process sync.
/// - **Privacy**: only anonymous data; no timestamps, no history, no PII.
///
/// Usage:
/// - Main app / recovery logic: `await SharedPlayerManager.shared.play()`, `.stop()`, etc.
/// - Widgets / Live Activities / intents: `SharedPlayerManager.shared.loadSharedState()`,
///   `loadPersistedVisualStateDirect()` (snapshot-first), `forcePersistVisualState(...)` (never instantiate a player).
///
/// See also: `DirectStreamingPlayer` (actual playback), `PlayerVisualState.swift` (the visual SSOT),
/// `WidgetRefreshManager.swift`, and `RadioLiveActivityManager.swift`.
///
/// ## Formal Documentation: State Machine & App Group Persistence Model
///
/// The tables below are the authoritative reference for this component.
/// They live in the source file so they are impossible to miss or drift from
/// the implementation.
///
/// ### Resurrection Protection & State Transition Rules
///
/// **Sticky States (never auto-resume)**:
/// - `.userPaused` — explicit user pause/stop. Set in `stop()`, `markAsUserPaused()`,
///   `setUserPaused()`. Cleared only by `setUserIntentToPlay()` or widget play paths
///   that call `clearUserPausedLockIfNeeded()`.
/// - `.securityLocked` — permanent security failure (DNS TXT fail, 403, cert error).
///   Set in `play()` guard and `setSecurityLocked()`. Persists until next explicit play
///   that passes validation.
///
/// **Cold-Launch Grace Period** (defined in this actor):
/// - `initializationSettlingPeriod = 5.0` seconds
/// - Total window = 25 seconds (`< initializationSettlingPeriod + 20.0`)
/// - `initialPlaybackHasRun` one-shot guard prevents duplicate automatic first-play attempts.
/// - `hasCompletedTrueColdLaunchPlay` records whether the app's first cold-launch play has run
///   (DEBUG classification only; does not drive resurrection guards).
/// - The window only relaxes resurrection protection for `.prePlay`; `.userPaused` is
///   *never* bypassed, even inside the window (enforced at the top of `play()`).
///
/// Cold-launch special casing is minimal; the one-shot and window logic are
/// subordinate to `currentPlaybackIntent`.
///
/// **Key Transition Methods**:
/// - `resetToPrePlayForNewStream()` — **only** place that intentionally sets `.prePlay`
///   after first launch (language/stream switches). Also clears `initialPlaybackHasRun`.
/// - `restoreVisualStateRespectingUserIntent()` — applies inline resurrection suppression (mustSuppressResurrection ? .userPaused : current).
/// - `attemptResurrectionIfAllowed()` — recovery path used by DirectStreamingPlayer nudges;
///   still respects `shouldAutoPlayOrResume`.
///
/// See `PlayerVisualState.swift` for `shouldAutoPlayOrResume`, `mustSuppressResurrection`,
/// and the `from(status:isManualPause:...)` mapper.
///
/// **Playback intent**: `currentPlaybackIntent` (owned exclusively by this actor via
/// `updatePlaybackIntent(to:)`) is the primary decision signal in the main resurrection paths:
///
/// - `play()` (top rule, central non-cold protection, one-shot simplification)
/// - `attemptResurrectionIfAllowed()`
/// - `restoreVisualStateRespectingUserIntent()`
/// The old overlapping visualState guards have been collapsed in the decision logic while
/// preserving (and making explicit) sticky `.userPaused` / `.securityLocked` resurrection
/// protection. Visual state remains the source of truth for UI/widget display.

/// ### Persistence Keys & Ownership (App Group "group.radio.lutheran.shared")

/// This design allows the system to operate with minimal reliance on short-lived optimistic keys
