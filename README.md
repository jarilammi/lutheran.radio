1. **Verify Project Build:** Confirm the project builds successfully with: ```xcodebuild -scheme "Lutheran Radio" -sdk iphonesimulator26.0 -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=26.0,name=iPhone 17' clean build```
   Ensure the output includes: **```** BUILD SUCCEEDED **```**

2. **Run Test Suite:** Validate the test suite passes with: ```xcodebuild -scheme "Lutheran Radio" -sdk iphonesimulator26.0 -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=26.0,name=iPhone 17' clean test```
   Check that the output includes: **```** TEST SUCCEEDED **```**

By verifying these steps on your local machine, you'll help maintain a consistent development environment for the project.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter build or test issues, try these steps:

1. **Set Xcode Path:** If Xcode commands aren't found, run: ```sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app```
   Verify that your desired iPhone model is available with: ```xcrun simctl list```

2. **Clean Build Folder**: ```xcodebuild clean```

3. **Clean Derived Data**: This removes all derived data for all projects, so use with caution: ```rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*```

After cleaning, retry the build and test steps above.

# Security Implementation

## Certificate Pinning

The app implements certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Key details:

1. **Domain:** ```lutheran.radio``` (including subdomains)
2. **Pinned Value:** SHA-256 fingerprint of the serverâ€™s leaf certificate, hex-encoded (uppercase, colon-separated)
3. **Location:** Embedded in ```Info.plist``` under ```NSAppTransportSecurity > NSPinnedDomains``` (primary) and ```CertificateValidator.swift``` (runtime validation)
4. **Current Fingerprint:** ```CC:F7:8E:09:EF:F3:3D:9A:5D:8B:B0:5C:74:28:0D:F6:BE:14:1C:C4:47:F9:69:C2:90:2C:43:97:66:8B:3D:CC```

### Dual Pinning Methods
For enhanced security, the app uses two complementary pinning approaches:

1. **SPKI Pinning (via Info.plist - Primary ATS Enforcement)**:
   - Pins the SHA-256 fingerprint of the certificate's public key (SPKI) in Base64 format.
   - Enforced by App Transport Security (ATS) for all connections to `lutheran.radio` (including subdomains).
   - Allows certificate rotations without app updates, as long as the public key remains consistent.
   - Current Pinned SPKI Fingerprints (from `Info.plist` under `NSAppTransportSecurity > NSPinnedDomains > lutheran.radio > NSPinnedLeafIdentities`):
     - `fwp4KADDyKqDa3qN5vy6UUJlffXBnjzrei3QTuYofYY=`
     - `XuAdGZ5Hy28pa2OHHMOry/fzpW8XyA5AV5bEDwSX2Ys=`
   - Verification: Use `openssl s_client -connect livestream.lutheran.radio:8443 -servername livestream.lutheran.radio < /dev/null | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64` and match against these values.

2. **Full Certificate Fingerprint Pinning (via CertificateValidator.swift - Runtime Validation)**:
   - Pins the SHA-256 fingerprint of the full certificate's DER representation (hex, uppercase, colon-separated).
   - Performed at runtime for stricter validation, with caching (10 minutes) and transition support.
   - Complements SPKI by ensuring exact certificate matches, with fallback to ATS during the transition period.

This dual approach provides defense-in-depth: SPKI handles baseline TLS security and rotations, while full pinning adds runtime enforcement. During the transition period (July 27â€“August 26, 2026), runtime validation allows pinning mismatches to the known alternate key (trusting ATS/SPKI) to prevent disruptions from certificate updates.

The app also detects potential device time manipulation by comparing the device time with the server's Date header during validation. If a significant discrepancy (beyond 5 minutes) is detected, or if the device is in the transition period but the server is not, transition leniency is disabled. This mitigates risks of exploiting the transition window through time manipulation, ensuring stricter enforcement when anomalies are present.

This check enhances security without additional dependencies, while protecting app users and preserving a seamless streaming experience under normal conditions.

### Certificate Renewal Strategy

To ensure uninterrupted service during SSL certificate renewals, the app includes a strategic transition system:

- **Transition Period:** One month before certificate expiry
- **User Experience:** During the transition period, the app trusts ATS validation if the pinned fingerprint fails, allowing streaming to continue with a debug warning (visible in DEBUG builds)
- **Security Protection:** Transition support is automatically enabled during the defined period, with strict enforcement of the pinned fingerprint outside this window
- **Implementation:** Controlled via `CertificateValidator.swift` with predefined transition start and expiry dates

This approach prevents service disruption during certificate updates while maintaining security through continued ATS enforcement and time-bounded operation.

### Why SHA-256?

- Strong collision resistance
- Fast verification for frequent connections
- Suitable for public key pinning (not sensitive data)

### Verifying the Certificate Fingerprint

To check or update the pinned fingerprint:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect livestream.lutheran.radio:8443 -servername livestream.lutheran.radio < /dev/null 2>/dev/null \
| openssl x509 -pubkey -noout \
| openssl pkey -pubin -inform pem -outform der \
| openssl dgst -sha256 -binary \
| base64
```

Match the output against the ```SPKI-SHA256-BASE64``` value in ```Info.plist```. Update if necessary.

## Security Model Validation

The app enforces security model validation to ensure only versions with an approved security implementation can stream content. This protects against compromised or obsolete app versions.

1. **Domain:** ```securitymodels.lutheran.radio```
2. **Mechanism:** Queries a DNS TXT record for a comma-separated list of valid security models (e.g., `"dc,florida,tampa,atlanta"`)
3. **Pinned Value:** Fixed security model string embedded in the app (currently `"atlanta"`)
4. **Location:** Defined in `DirectStreamingPlayer.swift` as `appSecurityModel`
5. **Behavior:** If the appâ€™s security model isnâ€™t in the TXT record, playback is permanently disabled with a user-facing error message

### Why DNS TXT Records?

- **Dynamic Updates:** Allows real-time revocation of compromised models by updating the TXT record, without requiring app updates.
- **Simplicity:** Leverages existing DNS infrastructure for lightweight validation, avoiding the need for a dedicated server.
- **Security:** Complements certificate pinning by linking app functionality to a centrally managed DNS record.

### Verifying the Security Model

To check the current valid security models:

```bash
dig +short TXT securitymodels.lutheran.radio
```

Example output:

```
"dc,florida,tampa,atlanta"
```

Compare this output to the security model defined in the app (found in ```DirectStreamingPlayer.swift``` as ```appSecurityModel```). If the appâ€™s model (e.g., "atlanta") isnâ€™t listed, it will fail validation. To update the list, modify the TXT record for ```securitymodels.lutheran.radio``` through the DNS management interface for the ```lutheran.radio``` domain.

### Security Model Validation Cache

To improve resilience against transient DNS failures (e.g., network instability or temporary outages), the app implements a 1-hour persistent cache for successful security model validations. This cache is stored securely in `UserDefaults` and only applies to successful checks, ensuring the app can skip redundant DNS queries during short disruptions without compromising security.

#### Key Details:
- **Duration:** 1 hour (3600 seconds) from the last successful validation.
- **Storage:** A non-sensitive timestamp (`Date`) is stored in `UserDefaults` under the key `"lastSecurityValidation"`. No actual security models or TXT records are cached.
- **Behavior:**
  - On app launch or validation trigger: If a valid cache exists (timestamp within 1 hour), the app assumes success and proceeds with streaming.
  - Cache is only updated on successful DNS fetches (i.e., when the embedded `appSecurityModel` matches the TXT record).
  - Failures are **not** cachedâ€”full validation (DNS query) is always performed on failure, with permanent disablement if the model is invalid.
  - Time handling uses an injectable `currentDate()` closure for testability and consistency.
- **Security Considerations:**
  - The cache introduces a short revocation delay: If a model is revoked via DNS TXT update, cached devices may continue for up to 1 hour. This is a balanced trade-off for usability in low-connectivity scenarios.
  - Mitigates risks like time manipulation (complements existing device/server time skew detection in certificate validation).
  - No new attack surfaces: `UserDefaults` is app-sandboxed; tampering requires device compromise.

#### Verifying the Cache
For debugging (e.g., in Xcode Console during development):
- Successful cache hit: Logs `"ðŸ”’ [Security] Using cached validation (last: [timestamp])"` (DEBUG builds only).
- Cache update: Logs `"ðŸ”’ [Security] Cached new successful validation"` on success.

To manually inspect or clear the cache:
- Use `UserDefaults.standard.object(forKey: "lastSecurityValidation") as? Date` in code or via debugger.
- Clear via app deletion/reinstall or `UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: "lastSecurityValidation")`.

This feature enhances availability while maintaining the app's privacy-first principles, reducing unnecessary network calls.

### Security Model TXT Record Usage

Lutheran Radio's security system uses a DNS TXT record to ensure only trusted app versions can stream content. The longest practical TXT record length for this purpose is about 450 bytes, which fits within standard DNS limits and supports up to 40-50 security model names (like "landvetter" or "nuuk"). This is more than enough for the current 24-byte record. If you need to use more names in the future, check that your DNS supports larger messages (EDNS0) and test the app to confirm it can handle them. Keep an eye on how your DNS behaves to ensure everything works smoothly, keeping the app secure and reliable for all users.

### Security Model History

To prevent naming collisions and maintain a clear history of security models, the table below lists all used security model names along with their validity periods. When selecting a new security model name, ensure it does not match any previously used name to avoid conflicts with older app versions or DNS TXT records.

| Security Model Name | Valid From       | Valid Until     | App Version Introduced |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| `turku`             | April 8, 2025    | April 20, 2025  | 1.0.4                  |
| `mariehamn`         | April 15, 2025   | July 26, 2025   | 1.0.7                  |
| `visby`             | May 26, 2025     | July 26, 2025   | 1.1.1                  |
| `landvetter`        | June 1, 2025     | July 26, 2025   | 1.1.2                  |
| `nuuk`              | June 15, 2025    | July 26, 2025   | 1.2.1                  |
| `stjohns`           | July 22, 2025    | August 20, 2025 | 1.2.3                  |
| `dc`                | July 27, 2025    | (ongoing)       | 1.2.4                  |
| `florida`           | August 24, 2025  | (ongoing)       | 1.2.7                  |
| `tampa`             | August 31, 2025  | (ongoing)       | 1.2.8                  |
| `atlanta`           | October 5, 2025  | (ongoing)       | 26.0.1                 |

**Notes:**
- **Valid From:** The date when the security model was first published to the App Store.
- **Valid Until:** The date when the security model was deprecated (or "(ongoing)" if still active).
- **App Version Introduced:** The app version where this security model was first implemented.
- **Valid From Dates:** Reflect the App Store publication date for the app version introducing the security model, ensuring alignment with public availability.
- When adding a new security model, append a new row to this table and update the DNS TXT record accordingly (see "Verifying the Security Model" above).

When introducing a new security model:

1. Choose a unique name not listed in the table (e.g., a distinct city or codename).
2. Update `appSecurityModel` in `DirectStreamingPlayer.swift` with the new name.
3. Add the new name to the DNS TXT record for `securitymodels.lutheran.radio`.
4. Append a new row to the table above with the current date, app version, and name.

### Why Track Security Model Names?

Security model names (e.g., ```atlanta```) are embedded in the app and validated against the DNS TXT record. Once a name is used, it becomes part of the app's history and may still exist in older versions. Reusing a name could inadvertently allow a deprecated or compromised version to pass validation, undermining security. By maintaining this table, we ensure that:

- New security model names are unique and avoid collisions with past names.
- The history of security models is transparent for debugging and auditing.
- Contributors can easily pick a fresh name (e.g., a unique city, codename, or identifier) when implementing a new security model.
