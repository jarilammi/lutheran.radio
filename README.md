## Local Development and Contributing

To ensure a smooth development experience, follow these steps before contributing:

1. **Verify Project Build:** Confirm the project builds successfully with: ```xcodebuild -scheme "Lutheran Radio" -sdk iphonesimulator18.4 -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=18.4,name=iPhone 16 Pro' clean build```
   Ensure the output includes: **```** BUILD SUCCEEDED **```**

2. **Run Test Suite:** Validate the test suite passes with: ```xcodebuild -scheme "Lutheran Radio" -sdk iphonesimulator18.4 -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=18.4,name=iPhone 16 Pro' clean test```
   Check that the output includes: **```** TEST SUCCEEDED **```**

By verifying these steps on your local machine, you'll help maintain a consistent development environment for the project.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter build or test issues, try these steps:

1. **Set Xcode Path:** If Xcode commands aren't found, run: ```sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app```
   Verify that your desired iPhone model is available with: ```xcrun simctl list```

2. **Clean Build Folder**: ```xcodebuild clean```

3. **Clean Derived Data**: This removes all derived data for all projects, so use with caution: ```rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*```

After cleaning, retry the build and test steps above.

# Security Implementation

## Certificate Pinning

The app implements certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Key details:

1. **Domain:** ```lutheran.radio``` (including subdomains)
2. **Pinned Value:** SHA-256 hash of the serverâ€™s public key, Base64-encoded
3. **Location:** Embedded in ```Info.plist``` under ```NSAppTransportSecurity > NSPinnedDomains```
4. **Current Hash:** ```mm31qgyBr2aXX8NzxmX/OeKzrUeOtxim4foWmxL4TZY=```

### Why SHA-256?

- Strong collision resistance
- Fast verification for frequent connections
- Suitable for public key pinning (not sensitive data)

### Verifying the Certificate Hash

To check or update the pinned hash:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect livestream.lutheran.radio:8443 -servername livestream.lutheran.radio < /dev/null 2>/dev/null \
| openssl x509 -pubkey -noout \
| openssl pkey -pubin -inform pem -outform der \
| openssl dgst -sha256 -binary \
| base64
```

Match the output against the ```SPKI-SHA256-BASE64``` value in ```Info.plist```. Update if necessary.

## Security Model Validation

The app enforces security model validation to ensure only versions with an approved security implementation can stream content. This protects against compromised or obsolete app versions.

1. **Domain:** ```securitymodels.lutheran.radio```
2. **Mechanism:** Queries a DNS TXT record for a comma-separated list of valid security models (e.g., `"mariehamn,turku"`)
3. **Pinned Value:** Fixed security model string embedded in the app (currently `"mariehamn"`)
4. **Location:** Defined in `DirectStreamingPlayer.swift` as `appSecurityModel`
5. **Behavior:** If the appâ€™s security model isnâ€™t in the TXT record, playback is permanently disabled with a user-facing error message

### Why DNS TXT Records?

- **Dynamic Updates:** Allows real-time revocation of compromised models by updating the TXT record, without requiring app updates.
- **Simplicity:** Leverages existing DNS infrastructure for lightweight validation, avoiding the need for a dedicated server.
- **Security:** Complements certificate pinning by linking app functionality to a centrally managed DNS record.

### Verifying the Security Model

To check the current valid security models:

```bash
dig +short TXT securitymodels.lutheran.radio
```

Example output:

```
"mariehamn,turku"
```

Compare this output to the security model defined in the app (found in ```DirectStreamingPlayer.swift``` as ```appSecurityModel```). If the appâ€™s model (e.g., "mariehamn") isnâ€™t listed, it will fail validation. To update the list, modify the TXT record for ```securitymodels.lutheran.radio``` through the DNS management interface for the ```lutheran.radio``` domain.

### Security Model History

To prevent naming collisions and maintain a clear history of security models, the table below lists all used security model names along with their validity periods. When selecting a new security model name, ensure it does not match any previously used name to avoid conflicts with older app versions or DNS TXT records.

| Security Model Name | Valid From       | Valid Until     | App Version Introduced |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| `turku`             | April 8, 2025    | (ongoing)       | 1.0.4                  |
| `mariehamn`         | April 15, 2025   | (ongoing)       | 1.0.7                  |

**Notes:**
- **Valid From:** The date when the security model was first published to the App Store.
- **Valid Until:** The date when the security model was deprecated (or "(ongoing)" if still active).
- **App Version Introduced:** The app version where this security model was first implemented.
- **Valid From Dates:** Reflect the App Store publication date for the app version introducing the security model, ensuring alignment with public availability.
- When adding a new security model, append a new row to this table and update the DNS TXT record accordingly (see "Verifying the Security Model" above).

When introducing a new security model:

1. Choose a unique name not listed in the table (e.g., a distinct city or codename).
2. Update `appSecurityModel` in `DirectStreamingPlayer.swift` with the new name.
3. Add the new name to the DNS TXT record for `securitymodels.lutheran.radio`.
4. Append a new row to the table above with the current date, app version, and name.
  
### Why Track Security Model Names?

Security model names (e.g., ```mariehamn```) are embedded in the app and validated against the DNS TXT record. Once a name is used, it becomes part of the app's history and may still exist in older versions. Reusing a name could inadvertently allow a deprecated or compromised version to pass validation, undermining security. By maintaining this table, we ensure that:

- New security model names are unique and avoid collisions with past names.
- The history of security models is transparent for debugging and auditing.
- Contributors can easily pick a fresh name (e.g., a unique city, codename, or identifier) when implementing a new security model.
