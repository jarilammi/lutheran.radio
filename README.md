## Local Development and Contributing

To ensure a smooth development experience, follow these steps before contributing:

1. **Verify Project Build:** Confirm the project builds successfully with: ```xcodebuild -scheme "Lutheran Radio" -sdk iphonesimulator18.2 -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=18.3.1,name=iPhone 16 Pro' clean build```
   Ensure the output includes: **```** BUILD SUCCEEDED **```**

2. **Run Test Suite:** Validate the test suite passes with: ```xcodebuild -scheme "Lutheran Radio" -sdk iphonesimulator18.2 -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=18.3.1,name=iPhone 16 Pro' clean test```
   Check that the output includes: **```** TEST SUCCEEDED **```**

By verifying these steps on your local machine, you'll help maintain a consistent development environment for the project.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter build or test issues, try these steps:

1. **Set Xcode Path:** If Xcode commands aren't found, run: ```sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app```
   Verify that your desired iPhone model is available with: ```xcrun simctl list```

2. **Clean Build Folder**: ```xcodebuild clean```

3. **Clean Derived Data**: This removes all derived data for all projects, so use with caution: ```rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*```

After cleaning, retry the build and test steps above.

# Security Implementation

## Certificate Pinning

The app implements certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This is achieved by:

1. Generating a SHA-512 hash of the server's public key during development
2. Embedding this hash in the app
3. Verifying the server's public key hash during each connection
4. Preventing redirects to maintain connection integrity with the fixed endpoint

### Implementation Note

While the codebase uses SHA-512 for certificate pinning, this is intentional and secure. Some security scanners may flag this as a potential issue because SHA-512 would be inappropriate for password hashing (where computationally expensive algorithms like bcrypt should be used). However, for certificate pinning:

- SHA-512 is cryptographically secure and appropriate for integrity verification
- Fast hash computation is desired since it occurs on every connection
- The use case is fundamentally different from password hashing

### Verifying the Certificate Hash

To verify or update the certificate hash:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect livestream.lutheran.radio:8443 -servername livestream.lutheran.radio < /dev/null 2>/dev/null \
| openssl x509 -pubkey -noout \
| openssl pkey -pubin -inform pem -outform der \
| openssl dgst -sha256 -binary \
| base64
```
